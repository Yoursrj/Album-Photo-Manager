//purpose of this file??---
//The purpose of the Panel.js file is to define a reusable React component called Panel.
//This component represents a panel or container element with customizable styling and the ability to include child elements.

//The Panel component receives several props, including children, className, and any additional props passed using the spread operator ...rest.
//The children prop represents the content to be rendered inside the Panel.
//The className prop allows for additional CSS classes to be applied to the Panel component, enabling further customization.

// Inside the Panel component, the classNames function from the classnames library is used to generate the final set of CSS classes. 
// The default classes for the panel include borders, rounded corners, padding, shadows, and a white background. The className prop, if provided, will be merged with the default classes to allow for additional styling flexibility.

// The rendered output of the Panel component is a div element with the combined CSS classes and the provided children rendered inside it.

// By encapsulating this panel functionality in a separate file, it promotes code reusability and maintainability. 
//Other components in the project can import and use the Panel component when they need a panel-like container with consistent styling and behavior.
